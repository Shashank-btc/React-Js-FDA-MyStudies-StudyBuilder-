Create a project "npx create-react-app my-react-app"
create a folder for backend to srun server " mkdir backend"
pointing to backend and add this "1.npm init -y"
								  2."npm install express mongoose"
now we need to add the code for the server and add the db connect and port and create poja classes
write the code for the CRUD operations
before try to call the CURD operations we need to add "npm install axios" to work with network calls (not in backed folder)
